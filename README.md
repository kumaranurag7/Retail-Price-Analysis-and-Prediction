# Retail-Price-Analysis-and-Prediction

We have a data of retail transactions over two year. Apart from data analysis and visualization, a regression model is developed to predict the price of retail items belonging to different categories. Foretelling the Retail price can be a daunting task due to the huge datasets with a variety of attributes ranging from Text, Numbers(floats, integers), and DateTime. Also, outliers can be a big problem when dealing with unit prices.

Evaluation metric: RMSE (Root mean squared error).

Main Topics Covered: Data Cleaning and Visualisaton, Feature Engineering, Over-sampling, Model Building, & hyper-parameter tuning.
